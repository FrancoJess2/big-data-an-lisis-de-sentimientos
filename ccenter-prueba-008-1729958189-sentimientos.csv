Just to rule out this possibility , may I ask you if other devices are working properly in that outlet ? If they are so , could you please remove the battery and then reconnect it once more time ? And I appreciate if you can connect it into another element . Are you deaf ? For the main thing is not the problem . OK , sir , I totally understand your situation and I will feel the same . But please calm down . Stop yelling at me and let me tell you what I could do for you , OK ? We usually send our product with an extra cable . Could you take a look inside the bus and verify We sent you an order . Another C . Oh , but there's not a cable in the dots . OK , let me see . Oh , sorry , sir . My mistake . According to my system , the extra cable was not included . Why have you guys good use of cable ? I'm sorry , sir , but this specific item was at a discount at the moment you purchased it . As a result , we didn't include the cable so that we could apply the best price on the device instead of charging you for stuff you won't need . OK , but is a lot of trouble going downtown to get a little table . If you want , you can order one from us . We'll keep it within 24 hours . No , I don't want you guys . Thanks anyway for doing your job , sir . I will got your feedback . My supervisor ? Yeah . Yeah , all right . Right now . I would like that , sir .",NEUTRAL,0.06443510949611664,0.0032422179356217384,0.9322888255119324,3.3922635338967666e-05
