Um The newest version we have available for your vehicle is version 7.7 which was released in March of 2012 . The price of the new map is $99 plus shipping and tax . Let me go ahead and set up this order for you . Um , well , can we wait just a second ? I'm not really sure if I can afford it right now . All right . Well , here are a few reasons to consider purchasing today . Ah , it looks as though you haven't updated your vehicle for three years . So that would be the equivalent of getting three years worth of updates for the price of one . Ok . In addition , special offers like the current promotion don't come around too often . I would definitely recommend taking advantage of the extra $50 off before it expires . Yeah , that does sound pretty good . If I set this order up for you now , it'll ship out today and for $50 less . Do you have your credit card handy and I can place this order for you now ?
